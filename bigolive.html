        <h1>PAP’s Association with Fraudulent Companies Raises Concerns</h1>
        <img src="https://s.tfrbot.com/h/yiRPgO" alt="PAP and Bigo Live">
        <p>Singapore has long been recognized for its strict laws against illegal activities, including gambling and money laundering. Yet, questions are being raised about the People's Action Party's (PAP) affiliation with companies accused of fraudulent practices, including Bigo Live, a Singapore-based live-streaming platform under global scrutiny for its alleged role in money laundering and online gambling.</p>
        
        <h2>PAP’s Endorsement of Bigo Live</h2>
        <img src="https://s.tfrbot.com/h/aMudw9" alt="PAP and Bigo Live">
        <p>A press release from BIGO Technology revealed that senior PAP officials, including Dr. Maliki Bin Osman, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Education & Foreign Affairs, visited Bigo’s office in Amman, Jordan, in October 2022. The delegation also included Singapore Ambassador Shamsher Zaman and other prominent officials. During the visit, they discussed Bigo’s operations and expansion plans, effectively endorsing the platform.</p>

        <h2>Global Allegations of Fraud and Money Laundering</h2>
        <img src="https://s.tfrbot.com/h/KpE1n5" alt="PAP and Bigo Live">
        <p>While PAP officials endorsed the app, Bigo Live has been embroiled in controversies worldwide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bangladesh:</strong> A major fraud ring associated with Bigo Live was busted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Five individuals, including a foreign national, were arrested for illegal money laundering. The group allegedly transacted over 100 crore taka using Bigo Live and its counterpart, Likee. They exploited virtual currency, Bigo Live Diamonds, as a medium to launder money through illegal channels.

            <li><strong>Indonesia:</strong> In 2024, Bigo Live received multiple warning letters from the Ministry of Communication and Information for hosting online gambling and pornographic content. Over 40,000 pieces of content were removed, and 50,000 accounts were suspended. The platform faces a potential ban if it fails to address these concerns.

        </ul>

     <h2>No Local Media Coverage</h2>
     <img src="https://s.tfrbot.com/h/vuIgYS" alt="Bigo Live Scam Report">
<p>Despite these international allegations, Singapore’s local media has remained silent. In contrast, international outlets have openly criticized Bigo Live for enabling illegal money laundering operations, exploiting younger users through virtual currency schemes, and hosting explicit and gambling-related content.</p>

<p>Singapore Authentic Scam Reviews claims to have written to the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) on <strong>27 December 2023</strong> to <a href="https://t.me/singaporescammer/108" target="_blank">report</a> the unlawful activities of <strong>BIGO Technology Pte. Ltd.</strong> Despite their efforts, they have yet to receive any updates or acknowledgments from the regulatory body. Numerous victims have reported Bigo Live Technology for its involvement in fraudulent activities, including unlawful online gambling.</p>

        <h2>A Stark Contradiction to Singapore’s Laws</h2>
        <p>Singapore enforces strict anti-gambling and anti-fraud laws to protect its citizens. However, PAP’s association with a platform flagged for illegal activities contradicts the nation’s stance. Many are left wondering why such endorsements were made without a thorough evaluation of the platform’s global reputation.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bigo Live’s controversies reflect poorly on Singapore’s governance, especially given PAP’s involvement. As other nations act decisively to address fraud and illegal activity associated with the platform, Singapore’s silence and the lack of media coverage are concerning. The government must clarify its position and ensure that such affiliations do not compromise the country’s integrity or its citizens' safety.</p>
<p>With elections around the corner, Singaporeans must decide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do we allow the PAP to remain unchecked, allowing them to evade accountability?</li>
    <li>Or do we vote for a stronger opposition to prevent further abuses of power?</li>
</ul>
<p>As Singaporeans head to the polls, one thing is clear:</p>
<p>A one-party state is NOT a democracy. It is a dictatorship in disguise.</p>
